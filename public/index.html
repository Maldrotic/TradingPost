            <dd>There is no button to reach the <a href="/categories">categories</a> endpoint, but that is because it is meant to be an administrative view. From here you can add new categories of instruments as well as give a category a new type of instrument.</dd>

              As a musician, I would like to be able to search for a specific item for sale so that I can determine if I would like to contact them about an offer.
              <br>
              <br>
              Steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Make sure that database is seeded</li>
                <li>Login to an account</li>
                <li>Navigate to 'Search Posts'</li>
                <li>Select 'Electric guitar' from the instrument list</li>
                <li>Click 'Search' button</li>
                <li>Verify that posts in the list have the are actual guitars</li>
              </ol>
              NOTE: This user story was slightly modified. I ended up having multiple ways to search for a post. Either by entering in a keyword that would match to the post's title, by selecting the type of instrument (in this case, an electric guitar), or by price.

              The system takes them through a guided search. The system will ask what kind of instrument they are looking for, then the user will select guitar, or a different instrument. Then the system will ask what kind of guitar they are looking for, or they can bring up the results from there. Depending on the instrument, the system will go through more categories. These categories ultimately will be added by the user so that the system doesn't have to update its own data.
              <br>
              <br>
              Steps:
              <ol>
                <li>Login to an account</li>
                <li>Navigate to 'Search Posts'</li>
                <li>Select the desired instrument from the instrument select input</li>
                <li>Click 'Search'</li>
                <li>The resulting list shows all posts of that instrument</li>
              </ol>
              NOTE: Also this user story came out a little different. Although it still ends up doing the same thing, it's not necessarily guided. I made it so that from the search field, the user can use any combination of filters (keyword on title, instrument type, minimum price, and maximum price) and depending on what is selected will result in a different list. The search results view will display what parameters are used to filter the posts.
